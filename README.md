# Favorito

Favorito translates to **Favorite in Portuguese**(at least that's what google says)

So well, this is a full fledged ruby on rails application that can be started on your local server and was developed with a **Behaviour Driven(BDD) and Test First Approach(TDD)**. Also called as Outside In Development.(In simple english, you write your features first, then work your way into writing the tests for models/libraries and controllers and make all tests green)

# User stories and Design Diagram

Based on the code assignment's problem description, **user stories** with features and scenarios are captured in a pdf document and also assuming these stories as the problem statement, a thorough human-friendly **design diagram** representing the proposed solution is included in the same pdf file. This design diagram shows how this core rails app, favorito is design and implemented in a object oriented dimension.

This document is located under design directory
